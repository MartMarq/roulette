# Roulette

Watchface for Watchy (SQFMI)

no wifi, no bluetooth but long battery life

there is a time adjustment routine in Uhr.cpp

every day at 0:30 it sets back time by 15 seconds and 500 ms, because my Watchy runs too fast. Just delete it (or set another adjustment)

by pressing the right upper button you can switch between the Roulette watchface and a simple watchface with numbers
